<b><font size=7> Changes from V7.4 to V8.0</font></b>

<P>
<H4>

Coq version 8.0 comes with two different concrete syntaxes called the
(old) V7 syntax and the (new) V8 syntax. An intermediate version has
been released under the name 8.0 beta. Bug-fix versions has then been
released under the name 8.0 pl1, 8.0 pl2 and 8.0 pl3.
 </H4>

<UL>
<LI> The
changes from previous version Coq 7.4 to 8.0 beta in (old) V7 syntax are
given <A HREF="#changes">first</A>.
<LI> The changes in Coq 8.0 beta related to the change of syntax are given 
<A HREF="#syntax">after</A>. 
<LI> Then <A HREF="#beta">come</A> a few additional changes from Coq
8.0 beta to Coq 8.0, then from Coq 8.0 to <A HREF="#pl1">Coq 8.0 pl1</A> and finally from Coq 8.0pl1 to <A HREF="#pl3">Coq 8.0 pl3</A>.

<UL>

<LI> Set now predicative by default

  notations containing this string
</UL>

<H3>Vernacular commands</H3>

</UL>

<H3>Library</H3>

  use the second name (Zle_Zmult_right2, Zle_mult_simpl), (OMEGA2,
  Zle_0_plus), (Zplus_assoc_l, Zplus_assoc), (Zmult_one, Zmult_1_n),
  (Zmult_assoc_l, Zmult_assoc), (Zmult_minus_distr, Zmult_Zminus_distr_l)

<LI> Replace can now replace proofs also
<LI> Fail levels are now decremented at "Match Context" blocks only and
  if the right-hand-side of "Match term With" are tactics, these
  tactics are never evaluated immediately and do not induce
  backtracking (in contrast with "Match Context")
<LI> Quantified names now avoid global names of the current module (like
  Intro names did) [source of rare incompatibilities: 2 changes in the set of
  user contribs]
<LI> NewDestruct/NewInduction accepts intro patterns as introduction names
<LI> NewDestruct/NewInduction now work for non-inductive type using option "using"
<LI> A NewInduction naming bug for inductive types with functional
  arguments (e.g. the accessibility predicate) has been fixed (source
  of incompatibilities)

  contradicts the type of c
<LI> Ring applies to new library NArith (require file NArithRing)
<LI> Field now works on types in Set
<LI> Auto with reals now try to replace le by ge (Rge_le is no longer an
  immediate hint), resulting in shorter proofs
<LI> Instantiate now works in hyps (syntax : Instantiate in ...)
<LI> Some new tactics : EConstructor, ELeft, Eright, ESplit, EExists
</UL>

<H3>Extraction</H3> (See details in contrib/extraction/CHANGES)
<UL>

<LI> The old commands: 	(Recursive) Extraction Module M.
  are now:              (Recursive) Extraction Library M. 
  To use these commands, M should come from a library M.v 
<LI> The other syntax Extraction & Recursive Extraction now accept 
  module names as arguments. 
</UL>

<H3>Bugs</H3>
<UL>

<LI> see coq-bugs server for the complete list of fixed bugs
</UL>

<H3>Miscellaneous</H3>
<UL>

<LI> Implicit parameters of inductive types definition now taken into
  account for infering other implicit arguments
</UL>

<H3>Incompatibilities</H3>
<UL>

<LI> Persistence of true_sub (4 incompatibilities in Coq user contributions)
<LI> Variable names of some constants changed for a better uniformity (2 changes
  in Coq user contributions)
<LI> Naming of quantified names in goal now avoid global names (2 occurrences)
<LI> NewInduction naming for inductive types with functional arguments
  (no incompatibility in Coq user contributions)
<LI> Contradiction now solve more goals (source of 2 incompatibilities)
<LI> Merge of eq and eqT may exceptionally result in subgoals now
  solved automatically
<LI> Redundant pairs of ZArith lemmas may have different names: it may
  cause "Apply/Rewrite with" to fail if using the first name of a pair
  of redundant lemmas (this is solved by renaming the variables bound by
  "with"; 3 incompatibilities in Coq user contribs)
<LI> ML programs referring to constants from fast_integer.v must use 
  "Coqlib.gen_constant_modules Coqlib.zarith_base_modules" instead
</UL>

<A NAME="syntax"></A>
<b><H1>Part 2: Changes from V8.0 beta in (old) V7 syntax to V8.0 beta</H1></b>

<H3>New concrete syntax</H3>
<UL>

<LI> A completely new syntax for terms
<LI> A more uniform syntax for tactics and the tactic language 
<LI> A few syntactic changes for vernacular commands
<LI> A smart automatic translator translating V8.0 files in old syntax to
  files valid for V8.0
</UL>

<H3>Syntax extensions</H3>
<UL>

<LI> "Grammar" for terms disappears
<LI> "Grammar" for tactics becomes "Tactic Notation"
<LI> "Syntax" disappears
<LI> Introduction of a notion of interpretation scope allowing to use the
  same notations in various contexts without using specific delimiters
  (e.g the same expression "4<=3+x" is interpreted either in "nat",
  "positive", "N" (previously "entier"), "Z", "R", depending on which
  interpretation scope is currently open) [see documentation for details]
<LI> Notation now mandatorily requires a precedence and associativity
  (default was to set precedence to 1 and associativity to none)
</UL>

<H3>Revision of the standard library</H3>
<UL>

<LI> Many lemmas and definitions names have been made more uniform mostly 
  in Arith, NArith, ZArith and Reals (e.g : "times" -> "Pmult",
  "times_sym" -> "Pmult_comm", "Zle_Zmult_pos_right" ->
  "Zmult_le_compat_r", "SUPERIEUR" -> "Gt", "ZERO" -> "Z0")
<LI> Order and names of arguments of basic lemmas on nat, Z, positive and R
  have been made uniform.
<LI> Notions of Coq initial state are declared with (strict) implicit arguments
<LI> eq merged with eqT: old eq disappear, new eq (written =) is old eqT
  and new eqT is syntactic sugar for new eq (notation == is an alias
  for = and is written as it, exceptional source of incompatibilities)
<LI> Similarly, ex, ex2, all, identity are merged with exT, exT2, allT, identityT
<LI> Arithmetical notations for nat, positive, N, Z, R, without needing
  any backquote or double-backquotes delimiters.
<LI> In Lists: new concrete notations; argument of nil is now implicit
<LI> All changes in the library are taken in charge by the translator
</UL>

<H3>Semantical changes during translation</H3>
<UL>

<LI> Recursive keyword set by default (and no longer needed) in Tactic Definition
<LI> Set Implicit Arguments is strict by default in new syntax
<LI> reductions in hypotheses of the form "... in H" now apply to the type
  also if H is a local definition
<LI> etc
</UL>

<H3>Gallina</H3>
<UL>

<LI> New syntax of the form "Inductive bool : Set := true, false : bool." for
  enumerated types
<LI> Experimental syntax of the form p.(fst) for record projections
  (activable with option "Set Printing Projections" which is
   recognized by the translator)
</UL>

<H3>Known problems of the automatic translation</H3>
<UL>

<LI> iso-latin-1 characters are no longer supported: move your files to
  7-bits ASCII or unicode before translation (swith to unicode is
  automatically done if a file is loaded and saved again by coqide)
<LI> Renaming in ZArith: incompatibilities in Coq user contribs due to
  merging names INZ, from Reals, and inject_nat.
<LI> Renaming and new lemmas in ZArith: may clash with names used by users
<LI> Restructuration of ZArith: replace requirement of specific modules
  in ZArith by "Require Import ZArith_base" or "Require Import ZArith"
<LI> Some implicit arguments must be made explicit before translation: typically
  for "length nil", the implicit argument of length must be made explicit
<LI> Grammar rules, Infix notations and V7.4 Notations must be updated wrt the
  new scheme for syntactic extensions (see translator documentation)
<LI> Unsafe for annotation Cases when constructors coercions are used or when
  annotations are eta-reduced predicates
</UL>

<A NAME="beta"></A>
<b><H1>Part 3: Changes from V8.0 beta to V8.0</H1></b>

<H3>Commands</H3>
<UL>

<LI> New option "Set Printing All" to deactivate all high-level forms of
  printing (implicit arguments, coercions, destructing let,
  if-then-else, notations, projections)
<LI> "Functional Scheme" and "Functional Induction" extended to polymorphic types
  and dependent types
<LI> Notation now allows recursive patterns, hence recovering parts of pre-V8 Grammar/Syntax commands
<LI> Command "Print." discontinued.
<LI> Redundant syntax "Implicit Arguments On/Off" discontinued

</UL>
<H3>New syntax</H3>
<UL

<LI> Semantics change of the if-then-else construction in new syntax: 
  "if c then t1 else t2" now stands for
  "match c with c1 _ ... _ => t1 | c2 _ ... _ => t2 end"
  with no dependency of t1 and t2 in the arguments of the constructors;
  this may cause incompatibilities for files translated using coq 8.0beta
