<H1>Introduction</H1>
This document is the Reference Manual of version 8.0 of the <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT> 
proof assistant. A companion volume, the <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT> Tutorial, is provided
for the beginners. It is advised to read the Tutorial first.
A new book&nbsp;[<A HREF="biblio.html#CoqArt"><CITE>13</CITE></A>] on practical uses of the <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT> system will
be published in 2004 and is a good support for both the beginner and
the advanced user.<BR>
<BR>
The <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT> system is designed to develop mathematical proofs, and
especially to write formal specifications, programs and to verify that
programs are correct with respect to their specification. It provides
a specification language named <FONT COLOR=navy>Gallina</FONT>. Terms of <FONT COLOR=navy>Gallina</FONT> can
represent programs as well as properties of these programs and proofs
of these properties. Using the so-called <I>Curry-Howard
 isomorphism</I>, programs, properties and proofs are formalized in the
same language called <I>Calculus of Inductive Constructions</I>,
that is a lambda-calculus with a rich type system. All logical
judgments in <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT> are typing judgments. The very heart of the Coq
system is the type-checking algorithm that checks the correctness of
proofs, in other words that checks that a program complies to its
specification. <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT> also provides an interactive proof assistant to
build proofs using specific programs called <I>tactics</I>.<BR>
<BR>
All services of the <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT> proof assistant are accessible by
interpretation of a command language called <I>the vernacular</I>.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT> has an interactive mode in which commands are interpreted as the
user types them in from the keyboard and a compiled mode where
commands are processed from a file. 
<UL><LI>
The interactive mode may be used as a debugging mode in which
 the user can develop his theories and proofs step by step,
 backtracking if needed and so on. The interactive mode is run with
 the <TT>coqtop</TT> command from the operating system (which we shall
 assume to be some variety of UNIX in the rest of this document).
<LI>The compiled mode acts as a proof checker taking a file
 containing a whole development in order to ensure its correctness.
 Moreover, <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT>'s compiler provides an output file containing a
 compact representation of its input. The compiled mode is run with
 the <TT>coqc</TT> command from the operating system. </UL>

These two modes are documented in chapter <A HREF="Reference-Manual014.html#Addoc-coqc">12</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Other modes of interaction with <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT> are possible: through an emacs
shell window, an emacs generic user-interface for proof assistant
(ProofGeneral&nbsp;[<A HREF="biblio.html#ProofGeneral"><CITE>1</CITE></A>]) or through a customized interface
(PCoq&nbsp;[<A HREF="biblio.html#Pcoq"><CITE>111</CITE></A>]). These facilities are not documented here. There
is also a <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT> Integrated Development Environment described in
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="Reference-Manual016.html#Addoc-coqide">14</A>.<BR>

<H2>How to read this book</H2>
This is a Reference Manual, not a User Manual, then it is not made for a
continuous reading. However, it has some structure that is explained
below.
<UL><LI>
The first part describes the specification language,
 Gallina. Chapters&nbsp;<A HREF="Reference-Manual003.html#Gallina">1</A> and&nbsp;<A HREF="Reference-Manual004.html#Gallina-extension">2</A>
 describe the concrete syntax as well as the meaning of programs,
 theorems and proofs in the Calculus of Inductive
 Constructions. Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="Reference-Manual005.html#Theories">3</A> describes the standard library
 of <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT>. Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="Reference-Manual006.html#Cic">4</A> is a mathematical description of the
 formalism. Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="Reference-Manual007.html#chapter:Modules">5</A> describes the module system.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The second part describes the proof engine. It is divided in
 five chapters. Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="Reference-Manual008.html#Vernacular-commands">6</A> presents all
 commands (we call them <EM>vernacular commands</EM>) that are not
 directly related to interactive proving: requests to the
 environment, complete or partial evaluation, loading and compiling
 files. How to start and stop proofs, do multiple proofs in parallel
 is explained in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="Reference-Manual009.html#Proof-handling">7</A>. In
 Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="Reference-Manual010.html#Tactics">8</A>, all commands that realize one or more steps
 of the proof are presented: we call them <EM>tactics</EM>. The
 language to combine these tactics into complex proof strategies is
 given in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="Reference-Manual011.html#TacticLanguage">9</A>. Examples of tactics are
 described in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="Reference-Manual012.html#Tactics-examples">10</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The third part describes how to extend the syntax of <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT>. It
corresponds to the Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="Reference-Manual013.html#Addoc-syntax">11</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>In the fourth part more practical tools are documented. First in
 Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="Reference-Manual014.html#Addoc-coqc">12</A>, the usage of <TT>coqc</TT> (batch mode)
 and <TT>coqtop</TT> (interactive mode) with their options is
 described. Then, in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="Reference-Manual015.html#Utilities">13</A>,
 various utilities that come with the <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT> distribution are
 presented.
 Finally, Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="Reference-Manual016.html#Addoc-coqide">14</A> describes the <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT> integrated
 development environment. 
</UL>
At the end of the document, after the global index, the user can find
specific indexes for tactics, vernacular commands, and error
messages. <BR>

<H2>List of additional documentation</H2>
This manual does not contain all the documentation the user may need
about <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT>. Various informations can be found in the following
documents: 
<DL COMPACT=compact><DT><B>Tutorial</B><DD> 
 A companion volume to this reference manual, the <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT> Tutorial, is
 aimed at gently introducing new users to developing proofs in <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT>
 without assuming prior knowledge of type theory. In a second step, the
 user can read also the tutorial on recursive types (document <TT>RecTutorial.ps</TT>).<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B>Addendum</B><DD> The fifth part (the Addendum) of the Reference Manual
 is distributed as a separate document. It contains more
 detailed documentation and examples about some specific aspects of the
 system that may interest only certain users. It shares the indexes,
 the page numbers and
 the bibliography with the Reference Manual. If you see in one of the
 indexes a page number that is outside the Reference Manual, it refers
 to the Addendum. <BR>
<BR>
<DT><B>Installation</B><DD> A text file INSTALL that comes with the sources
 explains how to install <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT>.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B>The <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT></B><B> standard library</B><DD>
A commented version of sources of the <FONT COLOR=navy>Coq</FONT> standard library
(including only the specifications, the proofs are removed) 
is given in the additional document <TT>Library.ps</TT>.</DL>
